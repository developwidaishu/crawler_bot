# crawler_bot
A multi threaded crawler that crawls the website and fetches the links and crawls all the links present in those pages as well.
#thread_specification
The number of threads in the program is to be hardcoded based on the machine on which the code is running.

The advantage is the multi threaded spiders that crawl all the sites with ease.

A video Demonstration of the same is available at
